Module 17 - Supervised Machine Learning 

## Project Overview

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.


#### Deliverable 1
RandomOverSampler, SMOTE and ClusterCentroids analysis:
- [x] 1. An accuracy score for the model is calculated
- [x] 2. A confusion matrix has been generated
- [x] 3. An imbalanced classification report has been generated


#### Deliverable 2
SMOTEENN analysis:
- [x] 1. An accuracy score for the model is calculated
- [x] 2. A confusion matrix has been generated
- [x] 3. An imbalanced classification report has been generated

#### Deliverable 3
BalancedRandomForestClassifier:
- [x] 1. An accuracy score for the model is calculated
- [x] 2. A confusion matrix has been generated
- [x] 3. An imbalanced classification report has been generated
- [x] 4. The features are sorted in descending order by feature importance

EasyEnsembleClassifier:
- [x] 5. An accuracy score of the model is calculated

#### Deliverable 4
- [x] 1. There is a title, and there are multiple sections
- [x] 2. Each section has a heading and subheading
- [x] 3. Links to images are working, and code is formatted and displayed correctly
- [x] 4. The purpose of this analysis is well defined
- [x] 5. There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models
- [x] 6. There is a summary of the results
- [x] 7. There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification


## Resources 

- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.58.1, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0


## Results


Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
